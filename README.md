## Credits

[H0L0](https://github.com/H0L0theBard) was _incredibly_ important in creating this bot and helping me troubleshoot things I was incredibly stupid about. She is the only reason the code is nearly as clean as it is and has the nice structure that it has now

[Lumi](https://github.com/LumiKattlin) and [Liz](https://github.com/stygia-dev) helped create the original log reading while I was away on vacation

[Tony](https://github.com/cyrv6737) created the entire price searching functionality, and introduced me to using API's and more libraries than I wasn't comfortable with before

[Gecko](https://github.com/GeckoEidechse) for introducing me to Poetry, as well as being the main reason I continued to write the bot
