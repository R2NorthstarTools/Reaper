# Commands
These commands are only usable by people in the permission list after I added them manually.

## General Channel Commands
`/togglechannel` toggles if the current channel is enabled or disabled for automatic replies

`/toggleuserreplies` toggles the inputted `user`'s ability to control if the bot can respond to them (this removes the chance that people abuse it and spam channels with it)

`/toggleglobalreplies` toggles the bot replying to _all_ allowed channels

`/togglemsdownreply` toggles the reply for the bot replying when the master server is down

## Other Commands
`/installation` sends the information for the `#installation` channel

`/setstatus` sets the bot status to say `Listening to {input}` where {input} is what you input into the command

`/permissionlist` gives a list of the users that have access to the bot's commands

## Commands for me
`/toggleusercommands` toggles the `user`'s ability to use the bot's higher level commands
