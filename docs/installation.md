# Installation

Reaper codebase uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.

Install dependencies with
```sh
poetry install
```

Create a `config.toml` based on the `example.config.toml` adjusting the values in the process.

Run the bot with
```sh
poetry run python reaper/main.py
```
