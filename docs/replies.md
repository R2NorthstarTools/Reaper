## Messages

Spectre will try to automatically reply to messages regarding:\
The "Couldn't find player account" error\
Controller not working on Northstar\
Questions on installing Northstar\
Help installing mods\
And, when enabled by a command, replying to mentions asking why errors are being encountered when the master server is down

These are not set in stone, and more will be added and some will be edited/removed. Spectre is also not perfect, and will sometimes not respond when supposed to, and sometimes respond when it isn't supposed to.


## Logs

Spectre also tries to automatically parse logs for:
1. HUD Revamp and client kill callback conflicts (two mods that currently cause issues when used together)
2. Cases where the user doesn't have the dependency [Client Kill Callback](https://northstar.thunderstore.io/package/S2Mods/ClientKillCallback/) intstalled
3. Audio override conflicts (where if two mods replace the same audio, the game crashes, or at minimal has issues)
4. Users with an out of date version of Northstar
5. When better server browser is installed (a now merged mod that breaks Northstar if installed)
6. Cases where the user doesn't have the dependency [Negativbild](https://northstar.thunderstore.io/package/odds/Negativbild/) installed
